// Question 141: Discuss the significance of the await reserved word in asynchronous JavaScript.
// Example use of the 'await' reserved word in asynchronous JavaScript
async function fetchData() {
    // Assuming fetchSomething returns a Promise
    const data = await fetchData();
    console.log(data);
    // The 'await' keyword pauses the execution until the Promise settles, and then resumes with the resolved value.
  }
  
  console.log(
    "The 'await' keyword allows asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner, more linear fashion."
  );
  // This demonstrates how 'await' improves readability and flow in asynchronous code.

// Overall, the await keyword plays a crucial role in asynchronous JavaScript programming, enabling developers to write cleaner, more readable, and maintainable code while still leveraging the power of asynchronous operations.
