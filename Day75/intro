🌐 Day 75 of my #100DaysOfCode challenge is complete! 🎉

Today, I took a fascinating dive into the world of the internet, exploring the behind-the-scenes mechanics of how it all works. I read an informative article and watched interactive videos that explained the intricate details of internet functionality.

Here’s what I learned:
🔗 The basic building blocks of the internet and how they interact to connect devices worldwide.
🌍 The journey of data packets from one computer to another across the globe.
🛠 The roles of key components like ISPs, DNS, IP addresses, and servers.
🔒 How data is transferred securely through protocols and encryption.
📶 The difference between different types of networks (LAN, WAN, etc.) and how they play a part in internet connectivity.

Understanding how the internet works not only satisfied my curiosity but also enriched my knowledge as a developer. It’s amazing to see the complex infrastructure and protocols that allow us to browse, communicate, and share information seamlessly every day.
